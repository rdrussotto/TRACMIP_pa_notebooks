# TRACMIP_pa_notebooks
Jupyter notebooks used to analyze polar amplification in the [TRACMIP](https://sites.google.com/site/tracmip/) multi-model ensemble.

This code is for a paper by Rick Russotto and Michela Biasutti submitted to Geophysical Research Letters in December 2019. 
Notebooks will be uploaded to Zenodo upon acceptance of the paper.
